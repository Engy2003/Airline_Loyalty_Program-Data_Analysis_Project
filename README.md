# Airline Loyalty Program Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes customer loyalty data for Northern Lights Air (NLA), a fictitious Canadian airline. The analysis focuses on key metrics like customer segmentation, loyalty retention, points usage, and revenue generation. The goal is to derive actionable insights from customer behavior to optimize the airline's loyalty program.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information from NLA's loyalty program, including sign-ups, enrollment, cancellation details, and additional customer attributes. The dataset is composed of the following four Excel files:

1. **Customer Flight Activity**: Contains data about customer flight activities, including the number of flights, distance flown, and points accumulated.
2. **Customer Loyalty History**: Provides data on customer loyalty, including enrollment dates and cancellations.
3. **Calendar**: Contains a calendar for tracking the time frames of activities such as flights and points accumulation.
4. **Airline Loyalty Data Dictionary**: Describes the fields and their meanings in the other files.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Extraction**: Extracted data from Excel files using Power BI.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned the data and created new columns such as salary categories and age groups to improve the clarity of visualizations.
3. **Data Modeling**: Created measures and groups to facilitate deeper analysis, such as customer segmentation and loyalty trends.
4. **Analysis**: Applied various analytical techniques to answer business questions, including segmentation based on flight activity, loyalty retention, geographic trends, and points usage.

## Analytical Questions Answered

The following key questions were explored:

- **Customer Segmentation**: 
  - How can customers be segmented based on their flight activity (e.g., frequent flyers vs. occasional flyers)?
  - What are the differences in flight activity (flights, distance, points) by demographics such as gender, education, and salary?

- **Customer Loyalty and Retention**: 
  - What is the average customer loyalty duration (from enrollment to cancellation)?
  - What factors correlate with loyalty or cancellation (e.g., salary, marital status, flight activity)?

- **Geographic Insights**: 
  - What regions (province, city) have the highest loyalty rates?
  - Which regions have higher cancellation rates?

- **Points Usage**: 
  - What percentage of accumulated points are redeemed vs. remaining unused?
  - What is the relationship between points redemption and distance flown?

- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: 
  - What factors influence CLV?
  - Who are the top 10% of customers by CLV, and what are their characteristics?

- **Seasonality and Customer Behavior**: 
  - How does flight activity change seasonally? 
  - How does the calendar impact customer loyalty?

- **Enrollment and Cancellation Trends**: 
  - How do enrollment and cancellation rates vary over time?
  - Are there any trends in customer activity and cancellations?

- **Revenue Insights**: 
  - How much revenue is generated through points redemption, and how does it vary across customer segments?

## Visualizations

The project includes a series of dynamic visualizations in Power BI to answer the above questions. Visualizations are tailored to present insights clearly and effectively, with key metrics like total flights, points accumulated, and customer loyalty trends.
